      <description>WIWI score: 7.3Taste: 8.5/10
Value: 5.5 (up to 7*)/10
Service and Atmosphere: 7.5/10
As of March 21, 2018 The Shop offers a Groupon where you get $7 off a purchase of $20 - bumps the value up to 7!What we orderedThe “French Melt” menu description: “Sticky, but worth it. Grilled french toast sandwich, seared ham, cheddar, and topped with real maple syrup”
My take: Uhhh, yeah a freaking cheesy breakfast sandwich on FRENCH TOAST with syrup!</description>

      <description>WIWI score: 7.65Taste: 9/10
Value: 6/10
Service and Atmosphere: 7/10
OverallI kind of want the WIWI score for Eggslut to be higher… The Fairfax sandwich on a biscuit was otherworldly, but their signature dish (“The Slut”) left me unimpressed which really forced their score to be lower than it should. I highly recommend going here. The restaurant is in the Grand Central Market in Downtown LA, and it’s extremely possible so you may have to wait quite a while before you place your order.</description>
