      <description>Two simple reasons:
I wanted to learn how to make a website using R blogdown.
I wanted to make it fun for myself, so I wanted to do something I was really passionate about… and God knows I LOVE to eat! So I’m developing a unique set of metrics for evaluating the places I eat, anywhere in the world I may be. The details of how I assess each restuarant are described in another post.</description>
