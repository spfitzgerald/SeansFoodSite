      <description>Two simple reasons:
I wanted to learn how to build my own website from scratch using R blogdown.
I wanted to make it fun for myself, so I wanted to do something I was really passionate about… and God knows I LOVE to eat! So I’m developing a unique set of metrics for evaluating the places I eat, anywhere in the world I may be. The details of how I assess each restuarant are described in another post.</description>

      <title>My Scoring Process (WIWI)</title>

      <description>What is WIWI??WIWI stands for “Was It Worth It?”. The biggest problem with Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc. is that people might give a restaurant with good food 4-5 stars, but that restaurant may be charging $30 a plate… If I could get the same quality food elsewhere for $15 a plate, obviously I would do so. Also I know they try to account for that with their $-$$$$ scale, but I find there’s still a huge range encapsulated in “$$” for example.</description>

      <description>WIWI score: 7.925Taste: 9.5/10
Value: 5/10
The BreakdownSpinach Pesto Pizza Menu Description: “Fresh spinach, basil-garlic-Parmesan pesto, homemade tomato sauce.”
My Take: I’ve eaten deep dish pizza twice in Chicago. Once at Lou Maltini’s, and once at another classic Chicago-style deep dish place (the name escapes me). Good thing no one outside my friend circle reads this website, because otherwise I’d have a lot of people really mad at me - because this Spinach Pesto deep dish from Paxti’s in Santa Barbara kicks the crap out of deep dish from the Motherland.</description>

      <description>WIWI score: 7.3Taste: 8.5/10
Value: 5.5 (up to 7*)/10
Service and Atmosphere: 7.5/10
As of March 21, 2018 The Shop offers a Groupon where you get $7 off a purchase of $20 - bumps the value up to 7!What we orderedThe “French Melt” menu description: “Sticky, but worth it. Grilled french toast sandwich, seared ham, cheddar, and topped with real maple syrup”
My take: Uhhh, yeah a freaking cheesy breakfast sandwich on FRENCH TOAST with syrup!</description>
