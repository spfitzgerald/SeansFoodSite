### Test review for The Shop

WIWI formula:   *WIWI* = 0.5(*Taste*) + 0.35(*Value*) + 0.15(*Service & Atmosphere*)

**WIWI:** 7.55 

**Taste:** 9/10

**Value:** 5.5 (up to 7*)/10

**Service and Atmosphere:** 7.5/10

* As of March 21, 2018 The Shop offers a Groupon where you get $7 off a purchase of $20 - bumps the value up to 7!

```{r, include=FALSE}
0.5*9 + 0.35*5.5 + 0.15*7.5

#Notes: you had to resize the images in paint for lack of a better option.  This was supposed to work:
# ![French Melt](/IMG_1087.JPG){ width = 50% }, but that made it REALLY small.  I think it's worth trying again next time though.
```

### What we ordered

**The "French Melt" menu description:** "Sticky, but worth it. Grilled french toast sandwich, seared ham, cheddar, and topped with real maple syrup"

**My take:**  Uhhh, yeah a freaking cheesy breakfast sandwich on FRENCH TOAST with syrup!?!?  This was exactly as decadent and delicious as it sounds.  

**Cost:** $12. 

**Taste:** 9/10

**The TUGBOAT menu description:** "Eggs Benedict with a grilled buttermilk biscuit topped with avocado, 2 poached eggs smoked tomato hollandaise and your choice of meat" (we got ours with Carnitas)

**My take:**  So I just absolutely love benedicts.  So I figured this would just be a really good benedict.  I was right, but what took me by surprise was how good the carnitas were - they stole the show.  I always love runny eggs & Hollandaise with hot sauce (they have Cholula), but the carnitas really took it all to the next level.  Awesome.  

**Cost:** $14. 

**Taste:** 9/10
