wiwi = vector(length = 1)
WIWI <- function(taste, value, service) {
  wiwi <- 0.5*taste + 0.35*value + 0.15*service
  return(wiwi)

### Overall

I kind of want the WIWI score for Eggslut to be higher...  The Fairfax sandwich on a biscuit was otherworldly, but their signature dish ("The Slut") left me unimpressed which really forced their score to be lower than  it should.  I highly recommend going here.  The restaurant is in the Grand Central Market in Downtown LA, and it's extremely possible so you may have to wait quite a while before you place your order.  Once you do, you just wait for your name to be called and can grab a seat anywhere.  The market is open-air, so we ate ours outside at a small table and it was perfect.  I also liked the fact that the "kitchen" is just the area behind the bar and you can see them make and grill the sandwiches as well as coddle the eggs, etc.


### What we ordered

**"The Slut" menu description:** "cage-free coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purÃ©e, poached in a glass jar, topped with gray salt and chives, served with slices of baguette"

**My take:**  Let's get the marginal stuff out of the way first... I thought it seemed really cool since I'd never had anything like it, but to me it was just pretty bland and left me unimpressed. It just tastes like you're dipping a hard baguette into mashed potatoes, which was cool for its novelty but not for taste. I will note, however, that I NEVER eat eggs without hot sauce but if that's not how you are, you might like this dish better than I did.  

**Cost (and Value):** $9 (4). 

**Taste:** 4/10

**The Fairfax menu description:** "cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a warm brioche bun"

**My take:**  Really good.  Nice and messy, too :)  The sriracha mayo and chives really take it up a notch - the brioche bun might be a teensy bit too thick (would prefer a slightly higher eggs-to-bread ratio), but it's light and fluffy so not too overwhelming.

**Cost (and Value:** $7 (7.5). 

**Taste:** 8.5/10

**The Fairfax WITH BUTTERMILK BISCUIT SUBSTITUTE:** You can pay $1 to substitute their house-made buttermilk biscuit for the brioche bun.  

**My take:**  This dish is why I would recommend people come from far and wide to eat here.  Holy cow.  I'm from the south (kind of - Florida is confusing), so I've had quite a few biscuits in my day - this is the best I've ever had.  And it pairs perfectly with the egg mixture to boot.  I can't say enough about how good this was, just unreal.  It's the first ever 10/10 for taste on the site!  I can't imagine a breakfast sandwich that tastes better - so until I experience such a thing, the Fairfax on a biscuit reigns supreme... GO EAT THIS SANDWICH.

**Cost (and Value:** $8 (9). 

**Taste:** 10/10
