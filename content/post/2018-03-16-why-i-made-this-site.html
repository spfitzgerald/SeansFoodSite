<p>Two simple reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I wanted to learn how to build my own website from scratch using R blogdown.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to make it fun for myself, so I wanted to do something I was really passionate about… and God knows I LOVE to eat! So I’m developing a unique set of metrics for evaluating the places I eat, anywhere in the world I may be. The details of how I assess each restuarant are described in another post.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>– SPF</p>
