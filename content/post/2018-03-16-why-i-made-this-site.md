The motivation for making this website came from a workshop I attended about the importance of creating your own personal website for professional purposes.  I don't really want one of those yet, but I did want to learn how to make a website using R blogdown.  As such, I figured the best way to motivate myself to learn the skills required was to do something I was really passionate about.  And God knows I LOVE to eat!  So I'm developing a unique set of metrics for evaluating the places I eat, anywhere in the world I may be.  The details of how I assess each restuarant will come in my second post!
