Two simple reasons:

1) I wanted to learn how to make a website using R blogdown.

2) I wanted to make it fun for myself, so I wanted to do something I was really passionate about... and God knows I LOVE to eat!  So I'm developing a unique set of metrics for evaluating the places I eat, anywhere in the world I may be.  The details of how I assess each restuarant are described in another post.
