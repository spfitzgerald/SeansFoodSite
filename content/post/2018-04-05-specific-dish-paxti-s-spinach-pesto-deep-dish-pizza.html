<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>Spinach Pesto Pizza Menu Description:</strong> “Fresh spinach, basil-garlic-Parmesan pesto, homemade tomato sauce.”</p>
<p><strong>My Take:</strong> I’ve eaten deep dish pizza twice in Chicago. Once at Lou Maltini’s, and once at another classic Chicago-style deep dish place (the name escapes me). Good thing no one outside my friend circle reads this website, because otherwise I’d have a lot of people really mad at me - because this Spinach Pesto deep dish from Paxti’s in Santa Barbara kicks the crap out of deep dish from the Motherland. Perfect crust, so insanely cheesy, and the pesto takes it to the next level. Three things to note: 1) I do NOT order this pizza to be “healthy” in any way. The lack of meat is a coincidence, this pizza is just absurdly good.<br />
2) I have had Paxti’s other varieties of pies, and they’re still quite good but nothing measures up to this bad boy. 3) You can order it half-baked, then finish it off in your oven at home! 4) It will set you back a pretty penny, but it will feed 3-4 normal people (or two Seans)</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $31 for a 14 inch ($26 and $22 for 12 and 10 inch, respectively)</p>
