<h3>What we ordered</h3>
<p><strong>The “French Melt” menu description:</strong> “Sticky, but worth it. Grilled french toast sandwich, seared ham, cheddar, and topped with real maple syrup”</p>
<p><strong>My take:</strong> Uhhh, yeah a freaking cheesy breakfast sandwich on FRENCH TOAST with syrup!?!? This was exactly as decadent and delicious as it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $12.</p>
<p><strong>Taste:</strong> 9/10</p>

<p><strong>The TUGBOAT menu description:</strong> “Eggs Benedict with a grilled buttermilk biscuit topped with avocado, 2 poached eggs smoked tomato hollandaise and your choice of meat” (we got ours with Carnitas)</p>
<p><strong>My take:</strong> So I just absolutely love benedicts. So I figured this would just be a really good benedict. I was right, but what took me by surprise was how good the carnitas were - they stole the show. I always love runny eggs &amp; Hollandaise with hot sauce (they have Cholula), but the carnitas really took it all to the next level. Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $14.</p>
<p><strong>Taste:</strong> 9/10</p>
